Everything on WordPress depends on the action and filter hooks. And they are the backbone of WordPress. You can enhance or customize any WordPress functionality by using these hooks. If you look at any WordPress page or post, they appear through the combination of action & filter hooks.

If you want to customize any functionality, whether it comes from a theme or plugin, you can customize it using their action and filter hooks without touching the core files. But sometimes, it is really hard to find what action or filter hooks you have to use to customize the functionality according to the need.
