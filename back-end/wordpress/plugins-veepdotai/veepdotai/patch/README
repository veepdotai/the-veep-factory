These files contain slight updates:

* so PHPHtmlParser provides comment support
* so wonolog Log libraries work with php8.1

# paquettg/php-html-parser

This package is required if you want to use the site creation feature, so comments in WP templates are kept, allowing native editing in WP.

# wonolog

This package is not required. If you don't bootstrap wonolog in the main veepdotai.php file by removing the comment, you don't need to install the inpsyde/wonolog path.
