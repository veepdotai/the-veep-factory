# Getting started with Veep

To test Veep with a computer, it must be equipped with a working microphone. Veep can also be tested with a smartphone (iPhone or Android).

The test steps are as follows:

* Create a Veep account (https://www.veep.ai) and log in (if you haven't already done so).
* Veep :
  * Interview (voice description of your project)
  * Site (extraction and creation of information by AI)
  * Editorial strategy
  * Editorial calendar: creation of a blog post with publication on Wordpress and LinkedIn

Help is available via the question mark at the top right of each screen. Help explains how the screen you're on works in detail.

A Beginner/Expert button at the top of each screen allows you to switch to expert mode and vice versa. Expert mode shows you all fields and buttons. By default, you are in beginner mode. We advise you to remain in beginner mode for this test, unless otherwise indicated.

In short, Veep = Content strategy with voice + AI.

* Click on the Veepdotai menu on the left if you're on a computer, or on the hamburger on the top left if you're on a smartphone.

# Interview: describing your project

Your project is described in 4 interviews:

* Benefits/Interest of your project for end-users
* Problems your project addresses
* Products and solutions you propose
* Strengths/Advantages of your project in relation to competitors, differentiation

Repeat for each of the above points:

* Click on Record (authorize the use of the microphone if the question is put to you)
* Speak naturally, answering the question as if you were talking to a friend or colleague.

A timer appears at the bottom of the screen. Speak for at least one minute (maximum 5 min.) to provide Veep with enough information to create content that is truly inspired by what you have to say. Don't hesitate to repeat yourself, using different wording.

* Click Stop when you're finished.
