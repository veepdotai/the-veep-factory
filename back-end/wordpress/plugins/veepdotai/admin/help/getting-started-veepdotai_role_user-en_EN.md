# First steps with Veep

Veep: making it easier for people with know-how to create content, and helping them get the word out.

## Introduction

When setting up a content strategy, there are usually 2 big problems to solve:
1. what are the 365 questions I'm going to answer this year?
2. what do I answer for each question?

In this test, the questions already exist: you just have to answer the question of the day, or another one if the current one doesn't inspire you. To make the test usable by everyone, the questions are about vacations. All you have to do is give your opinion, an example or anything else you'd like to say on the subject of the day.

You'll be able to test:
* creating content by voice
* publishing a blog article
* publishing a "linkedin" version of this blog post
