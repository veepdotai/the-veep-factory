## Interview

Thanks to voice (Vocal) and artificial intelligence (AI), Veep creates your content strategy in the broadest sense, automatically while being personalized, simply and quickly.

This content strategy consists of :
* a website (1 landing page + 1 page per interview)
* blog articles
* posts for social networks.

The website is currently a Wordpress site, blog articles are published on the same site and posts can be published on LinkedIn.

### Instructions for use

The interview is the keystone of the website. It provides the context for AI to generate meaningful content. In fact, it breaks down into 4 interviews, presenting different aspects of the project, accessible via the following tabs:

* Benefits: the interests of the project for end-users,
* Problems: problems you're solving,
* Solutions: products and solutions you propose,
* Strengths: advantages over existing solutions, enabling you to differentiate yourself from your competitors.

These questions are very generic. They allow you to describe the interest of your project, whether professional or personal, for business or an association, for vacation...

In interviews, don't hesitate to repeat yourself. This will provide Veep with more information, enabling it to generate more content, with different keywords, which will contribute to improving the quality of your SEO.

By then answering questions regularly, one a day for example, you'll be able to create content in just a few minutes, directly inspired by your answers, which will be reformulated by the AI. Be sure to speak for between 1 and 2 minutes, **with a maximum of 5 minutes**.

You can (re)do each interview independently. Don't forget to transcribe them so that the AI can analyze them later.

#### Benefits

When you arrive at Interview, you are by default on the Profits tab.

Click on the green "Record" button. Authorize the use of the microphone if the question is put to you. 

You can now answer the question about the benefits of your project for end-users. 

Normally, the question should seem very simple to you, as it deals with a subject you know by heart. Your answer is as natural as if it were a discussion with a family member, a friend, a colleague or a customer.

When the answer is complete, click "Stop". You can then :
* listen to your message (I wouldn't recommend this - do you listen to your conversations with family and colleagues?)
* delete your message (and start again),
* move on to the next tab (click on "Problems").

**Click on the transcribe action to have the AI transform the voice into text.

#### Problems

Click on the "Problems" tab.

Do as above, but answer the question about the problems you're addressing with your project. This problem should resonate with the difficulties your target is experiencing.

Don't hesitate to repeat yourself...

When you've finished this interview :

**click on Retranscribe**.
* click on the Solutions tab.

#### Solutions

Click on the "Problems" tab.

You do the same as before, but present the products and solutions you offer, indicating their main features and typical use cases. The description of functionalities should resonate with your future users.

Don't hesitate to repeat yourself...

When you have finished this interview :

* **click on Transcribe**
* click on the "Strengths" tab.

#### Strengths

Click on the "Strengthz" tab.

You do the same as before, but this time emphasize the strengths of your project that differentiate you from your competitors.

Don't hesitate to repeat yourself... Veep will generate richer, more relevant content. Your overall SEO will be better and your content strategy more effective.
