# Introduction

Discover **Veep.AI in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Go to https://app.veep.ai and log in using your Google account.

## Account Creation

With Veep.AI, logging in with your Google account is enough to create an account.

## Dashboard

Once logged in, the following dashboard appears. You can see:
* the number of credits and tokens used
* your most recently generated documents
* the latest shared generated documents you have access to (generally the teams/organizations/services/projects you are part of)

## Content Creation

Veep.AI takes input content and produces the expected content based on the chosen veeplet.

The input can be:
* a voice recording, i.e., an audio you record live in Veep. Currently, the voice recording cannot exceed 40 minutes.
* an audio file, PDF, MS Office (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx…), *office (.odt, .ods, .odp), text… Only 50KB will be taken into account (which already makes a 100-page book).
* text provided in the entry area by copying and pasting. Only 50KB will be taken into account (which still makes a book of 100 pages).
* a URL. Note, only non-Javascript sites are taken into account.

The veeplets are, at the time of writing:
* Category Comm/marketing:
  * 3 LI posts: to create 3 LinkedIn posts with a different tone
  * LI + FB + Insta: to create a LinkedIn post, a Facebook post, an Instagram post
  * LI for the week: to create 5 LinkedIn posts, one for each weekday
* Category Transverse:
  * Summary Sheet: to create a 5-page summary document (introduction, development over 3 paragraphs, conclusion)

When you click Go!, depending on the chosen veeplet, several intermediate contents will be generated:
* Transcription: this is the text obtained from the audio, file, text, or URL provided.

:::danger[Attention]
After transcription, the process stops as you can modify the corresponding content to, for example, correct a proper name or a word misunderstood by the AI.
:::

:::tip[Click Continue]
Click Continue for the generation to resume. Generally, at each stop panel, represented by the corresponding icon, the generation process pauses. You must then click Continue for the process to resume.
:::

The veeplet is preconfigured with a certain number of steps. You can create your own veeplet and add as many steps as you wish (for example, 30 to generate 30 LinkedIn posts for the current month? More on that later.)

Depending on the chosen veeplet, the content might include:
* 3 LinkedIn posts, generated with different tones, allowing you to compare the posts and choose the one that interests you
* 3 posts including a LinkedIn post, an Instagram post, and a Facebook post
* a 5-page summary sheet detailing the input information. This sheet consists of a plan, an introduction, 3 paragraphs, and a conclusion.

At the end of the execution of the veeplet, items are accessed via the "My Content" menu where they can be modified and saved for later use.

## Library

You can browse the list of available veeplets. A veeplet is a sequence of instructions that allows you to create content or a document in one or more steps.

Veeplets are categorized into categories and subcategories. For example:
* Communication/marketing: you will find veeplets that allow creating LinkedIn posts or blog articles
* Transverse: you will find veeplets that meet various needs, such as meeting minutes, summary sheets...

To use a veeplet, simply click on Go!

## Creating a Veeplet

If you want to tailor a veeplet to your needs, you must customize it, which will result in it being copied to your workspace.

When you are on a veeplet and click on Customize, a form opens with all the information characterizing it. If you click OK and then Save without any changes, the veeplet will be copied as is into your workspace. It will therefore appear in the same category, with exactly the same titles, summaries...

Feel free to change the name, title, summary, and category of the veeplet. You can later configure the AI-provided instructions to personalize the content and document generation.

## My Content

You can review the content and documents you have generated. Clicking on content accesses its details:
* Aggregated Content: this view combines the generated elements into one whole.
* Comparative View: this view allows for comparing elements side by side, two at a time or three at a time.
* Edit Content 1..n: these views allow editing and saving the corresponding contents. The aggregated view and comparative view are based on these contents. These will serve as the basis for further generations.
* Metadata: this view presents the source, corresponding to the transcription, as well as the prompt used to transform the content.

## Support

This menu provides access to documentation and all resources (videos…) available to assist you.

Forums are accessible through your Google account. Feel free to select the category of your choice, starting with the language, and ask your question.
