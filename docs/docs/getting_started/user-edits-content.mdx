# As a User, Edit Generated Artefact (Content/Document)

An artefact may be:
* Content: usually for social contents, which are often short. Think about them like posts for LinkedIn, X, Insta, Facebook...
* Document: usually for reports, case studies, white papers, articles from a few pages to a lot like books

## Steps

* Select generated artefact
* Edit it, make your updates
* Save

### Select generated artefact

From the artefacts list, click on the one you want to edit. You can:
* sort the table by clicking on the column header
* search for content in the information contained in the table
* select a category to restrict artefacts list (to do #?)

A window opens with, on the left the discussion with the AI that gives the artefacts, and on the right, the elements that have been agregated to produce the result.

You can then edit this result. Once you're done, don't forget to save it.
