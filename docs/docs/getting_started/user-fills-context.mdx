# As a User, Fills Context

A context must be defined initially by the AI manager so generated artefacts are relevant.

## Steps

Context is structured in 4 parts
* Brand values, History and Anecdotes
* Pitch about project/organization/company/person
* Content pillars, ideas
* Writing style
* Repurposing pattern

### Brand values, History and Anecdotes

Give the values that are important for you and your project/organization/company. They are a big part of the spine of your artefacts. Whatever the generated artefact, it must always respect these values.

Every project/organization/company is a story of wo-men who decide to join to create a bigger sum than they are. Tell their story. Better, help them to tell their story themselves. 

Anecdotes are things we care (even, especially? when we say it doesn't). Give some details about events you think are important. They will constitute kind of anchors employees, customers, partners and prospects will remember.

All of this is story telling, but the more authentic it is, the more efficient il will be. You can use Veep of course to create fill this form and use voice to make it easy, have fun and more autenticity too.

### Pitch about project/organization/company/person

Your project has an ultimate goal. It is the reason why you wake up every morning with a big smile. If not, change job :-)

A pitch in business area is very classically composed of benefits for users, pain they have, product/solution you provide to solve these pains and competitive advantage you have. Same rules apply if you are an association and not a company.

This pitch completes values and constitutes the other part of the spine.  

### Content pillars, Ideation

All generated artefacts, contents or documents, must have one or two common points. They constitute the pillars of your content.

Around these points, you have related words in a semantic cocoon so at the end, all contents are connected to the two main pillars.

These elements may give you some hints or ideas when it is need to create some content and you haven't the faintest clue of an idea to write something about.

### Writing style

Writing style may be analyzed according the following criteria:

* Vocabulary: The use of specific words, their complexity, the extent of the lexicon, and the use of jargon or slang greatly contribute to defining a writing style. Some authors may prefer simple and direct language, while others opt for more sophisticated or technical terms.
* Syntax: This includes sentence length, the complexity of sentence construction, the use of short and sharp sentences or, on the contrary, long and flowing sentences. Syntax also influences the reading rhythm and the way ideas are assembled.
* Tone: The tone reflects the author's attitude towards the subject and the readers. It can be formal, informal, humorous, serious, sarcastic, warm, cold, etc. The tone adds emotional color to the text and helps establish a connection with the reader.
* Point of view: The perspective from which a story is told influences the writing style. Choosing between first person, second person, or third person, omniscient or limited, changes the way the story is presented and received.
* Structure: The way a text is organized can define a writing style. This includes not only the overall structure of a work (for example, chronological, non-linear, in flashback) but also the structure of paragraphs and chapters. The consistency and clarity of the structure contribute to the author's stylistic signature.

Among all these criteria and their available value, you can build the style you want. You can also use Veep to infer the style from an existing content. Generated artefacts will then be close to the original one with the same "colour" and "taste".  

### Repurposing pattern

Repurposing depends of the following information:
* Publication frequency: 1x, 2x..., 5x...
* Frequency type: day, week, month...
* Communication Framework: xOFU, AARRR...

At the end, these informations enable you to indicate you want to communicate various times a week according xOFU or AARRR framework. You then give details about repurposing distribution rythm(Monday, Tuesday...):
* 3x/week/xOFU: TOFU on tuesday, MOFU on wednesday, BOFU on thirsday 
* 5x//AARRR: A1 on tuesday and A2 on
 thirsday on first week, R1 on tuesday, R2 on wednesday and R3 on thirsday of second week
