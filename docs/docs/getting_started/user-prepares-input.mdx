# As a User, Prepare Input

## Steps

* Give some input
* Generate
* Continue

## Details

### Give some input

For the moment, the following input are available:

1. Voice: directly through the microphone
1. File: video, audio, pdf, txt, MS Office ou Office 365 (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx), LibreOffice or StarOffice (.odt, .ods, .odp)
1. Content in the input box through a copy'n paste for example
1. URL, html website, not in javascript (like webflow...), and only one at a time for the moment

:::tip

My favorite input type is the voice because it's easy and authentic, recorded on my smartphone. I can use it later and recording is robust. No risk to lose your 10 min discussion with yourself ;-)  

:::

:::warning

If your content is big, processing may take some time. For example, to process video/audio files of 3 min length, which is not that bad (you'll see :-) takes about 1 min processing. So be patient.

:::

:::info

It is possible to go quicker, in real-time and in local, all at once, which is good for XP and confidentiality :-) Unfortunately, it's really more expensive because you need a GPU.

### Generate

After you give some input, click on Go. Then you can see a window with the set of steps for the veeplet you chose and the progression of the generation. Each a time a step is finished, a red bullet appears next to it.

### Continue

Generally, a continue button appears after that. Click on it to just continue. This button is set up because in a near future, you'll be able to fix and correct the text so next generations take into account your updates, to avoir bad context for future generations.
