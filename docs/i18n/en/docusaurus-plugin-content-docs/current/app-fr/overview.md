This documentation is in progress and presents the different parts and functions of Veep:

* Part 1: The context
* Part 2: The assistants
* Part 3: Document editing and composition
* Part 4: PDF export and publication

This document was created using the following steps:

1. ~~It was first generated from a 30-minute audio recording covering each of the parts.~~
2. ~~Then a preliminary aggregation was done to obtain the current document.~~
3. ~~Next, a quick proofreading was performed to correct gross errors, remove redundant elements, and provide more structure.~~
4. Finally, a consolidation and PDF export will be carried out.

Step 1 has already been initiated by Veep. Steps 2, 3, and 4 will be automated by Veep in the short term.
