Veep aims to help users create artifacts (content and documents). To achieve this goal, it structures the creation into 6 main phases:
* Specification: to provide context and make the generation more relevant
* Configuration/Selection: to configure or use the catalog of assistants according to your role
* Execution: to process the assistant and generate a draft
* Editing: to read, correct, and finalize the artifact
* Export/Publication: to export (as PDF) and publish the artifact
<!-- Follow-up 2: Some elements influence your invoice and need to be managed (use of AI, storage, bandwidth...) -->
