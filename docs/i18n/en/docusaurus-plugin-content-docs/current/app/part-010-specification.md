# Specification: Context Configuration

When you interact a bit with an AI, you quickly realize that the generation is interesting but also generic. To make things more relevant, you ask it to detail its response for a specific situation.

This situation IS the context. It allows the AI to utilize information related to your true needs.

The context is generally structured around a common and a specific aspect.
* The common context concerns who you are, where you come from, where you are going...
* The specific context relates to who you are (as a person), your role in the organization, your task, and finally the situation (project, task...), what you are doing, and now.

The initial information you provide to the AI, from which it will act to create the artifact, is what we could call inspiration. Inspiration is, in a way, the ultimate context.

## Common Context

</div>

It consists of generalities about your values, the pitch of your project, and also more detailed information about your audience, the style you wish to use, and all elements that will ultimately form an editorial line.

Veep currently offers you a form with the following information that you need to fill out:
* Brand values
* Pitch: benefits, pains, products and solutions, competitive advantages
* Content: industry, keywords
* Audience: For whom your project solves pains and provides benefits that you have identified
* Style elements: vocabulary, syntax, point of view, tone...

## Specific Context

The specific context can simply be a more detailed common context.

To be defined.
