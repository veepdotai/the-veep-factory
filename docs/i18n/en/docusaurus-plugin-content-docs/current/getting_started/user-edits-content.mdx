# As a user, edit the generated artifact (Content/Document)

An artifact can be:
* Content: generally for social content, which is often short. Think of them as posts for LinkedIn, X, Insta, Facebook...
* Document: generally for reports, case studies, white papers, articles ranging from a few pages to complete works.

## Steps

* Select the generated artifact
* Modify it, make your updates
* Save

### Select a generated artifact

In the list of artifacts, click on the one you want to modify. You can:
* sort the table by clicking on the column header
* search for content within the information contained in the table
* select a category to narrow down the list of artifacts (to be done #?)

### Edit the artifact

After clicking on an artifact, a window opens with:
* on the left: the discussion with the AI that provides the artifacts
* on the right, the items that have been aggregated to produce the result. This is your current content or document.

You can then edit this result. The goal is to focus on:
* structure (heading 1...) : this is why only bold, italic, and underline features are available. Once you are done, don’t forget to save it. Don’t expect to find styles in this area.
* text: proofread the text, remove redundancies, rephrase to match your exact needs. You may sometimes benefit from AI assistance and ask to shorten, expand, simplify... You can also use the assistant from your catalog if it has been designed for this purpose.
