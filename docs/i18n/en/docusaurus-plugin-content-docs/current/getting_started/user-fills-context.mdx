# As a user, Fill in the context

A context must be defined in advance by the AI manager so that the generated artifacts are relevant.

## Steps

The context is structured into 4 parts
* Brand values, history, and anecdotes
* Presentation of the project/organization/company/person
* Content pillars, ideas
* Writing style
* Reusability model

### Brand Values, History, and Anecdotes

Provide the values that are important to you and your project/organization/company. They are an integral part of the backbone of your artifacts. No matter what artifact is generated, it must always respect these values.

Every project/organization/company is the story of men and women who decide to unite to create something greater than what they are individually. Tell their story. Even better, help them tell their story themselves.

Anecdotes are elements that are dear to us (even more so when we claim the opposite). Provide some details about events that you consider important. They will serve as hooks that employees, customers, partners, and prospects will remember.

All of this is storytelling, but the more authentic it is, the more effective it will be. You can certainly use Veep to fill out this form and use voice to make it easier, more fun, and more authentic too.

### Presentation of the Project/Organization/Company/Person

Your project has an ultimate goal. Itâ€™s the reason you get up every morning with a big smile. If not, change professions :-)

A business presentation is typically made up of the benefits for users, the problems they face, the product/solution you offer to solve these problems, and the competitive advantage you have. The same rules apply if you are an association rather than a company.

This presentation complements the values and constitutes the other part of the backbone.

### Content Pillars, Ideation

All generated artifacts, content, or documents must share one or two common points. They form the pillars of your content.

Around these points, you have associated words in a semantic cluster so that in the end, all content is linked to the two main pillars.

These elements can give you clues or ideas when you need to create content and have no idea what to write about.

### Writing Style

The writing style can be analyzed according to the following criteria:

* Vocabulary: The use of specific words, their complexity, the range of vocabulary, and the use of jargon or slang greatly contribute to defining a writing style. Some authors prefer simple and direct language, while others opt for more sophisticated or technical terms.
* Syntax: This includes the length of sentences, the complexity of sentence construction, the use of short and impactful sentences or, on the contrary, long and fluid sentences. Syntax also influences the reading rhythm and the way ideas are assembled.
* Tone: The tone reflects the author's attitude towards the subject and the readers. It can be formal, informal, humorous, serious, sarcastic, warm, cold, etc. The tone adds emotional color to the text and helps establish a connection with the reader.
* Point of View: The perspective from which a story is told influences the writing style. The choice between first person, second person, or third person, whether omniscient or limited, changes the way the story is presented and received.
* Structure: The way a text is organized can define a writing style. This includes not only the overall structure of a work (e.g., chronological, non-linear, flashback) but also the structure of paragraphs and chapters. Consistency and clarity of structure contribute to the author's stylistic signature.

Among all these criteria and their available values, you can construct the style you want. You can also use Veep to infer the style from existing content. The generated artifacts will then be close to the original with the same "color" and "taste".

### Reusability Model

Reusability depends on the following information:
* Frequency of publication: 1x, 2x..., 5x...
* Type of frequency: day, week, month...
* Communication framework: xOFU, AARRR...

In the end, this information allows you to indicate that you wish to communicate several times a week according to the xOFU or AARRR framework. You then provide details on the rhythm of reuse (Monday, Tuesday...):
* 3x/week/xOFU: TOFU on Tuesday, MOFU on Wednesday, BOFU on Thursday
* 5x/AARRR: A1 on Tuesday and A2 on Thursday of the first week, R1 on Tuesday, R2 on Wednesday, and R3 on Thursday of the second week
