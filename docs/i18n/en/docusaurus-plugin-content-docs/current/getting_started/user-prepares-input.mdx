# As a user, prepare the input

## Steps

* Provide an input

## Details

### Provide an input

For now, the following inputs are available:

1. Voice: directly via the microphone
1. File: video, audio, pdf, txt, MS Office or Office 365 (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx), LibreOffice or StarOffice (.odt, .ods, .odp)
1. Content in the input area, for example by copy-pasting
1. URL, HTML website, not in JavaScript (like Webflow...), and only one at a time for now

:::tip
My preferred type of input is voice because it’s easy and authentic, recorded on my smartphone. I can use it later, and the recording is robust. No risk of losing your 10-minute discussion with yourself ;-)

:::warning
If your content is large, processing may take some time. For example, processing video/audio files that are 3 minutes long, which isn't too bad (you'll see ;-) takes about 1 minute of processing time. So, please be patient.

:::info
It’s possible to go faster, in real-time and locally, all at once, which is great for the experience and privacy :-) Unfortunately, it's really more expensive because you need a GPU.
