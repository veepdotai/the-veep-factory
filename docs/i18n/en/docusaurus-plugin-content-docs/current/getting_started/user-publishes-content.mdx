# As a user, Publish Content

Publishing can take various forms depending on your objectives:
* PDF document to be sent as an attachment
* Document to be archived in your preferred ECM (Google Drive, Sharepoint or Office 365, NextCloud...) or link in your preferred application (ERP, CRM...)
* Web page to be published on your website
* Publication on LinkedIn, with a carousel, to be published on your personal or business page
* Instagram story, to be published on your Insta account
* Publication X
* Article to be published on LinkedIn, Medium, your website...

## Steps
