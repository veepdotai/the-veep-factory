## Details

### Provide an input

For now, the following types of input are available:

1. Voice: directly through the microphone
1. File: video, audio, pdf, txt, MS Office or Office 365 (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx), LibreOffice or StarOffice (.odt, .ods, .odp)
1. Content in the input box, for example by copying and pasting
1. URL, html website, not in javascript (like webflow...), and only one at a time for now

:::tip

My preferred input type is voice because it's easy and authentic, recorded on my smartphone. I can use it later, and the recording is reliable. No risk of losing your 10 minutes of talking to yourself ;-)

:::

:::warning

If your content is large, processing may take some time. For example, processing video/audio files that are 3 minutes long, which isnâ€™t so bad (you'll see :-) takes about 1 minute of processing time. So please be patient.

:::

:::info

It is possible to go faster, in real-time and locally, all at once, which is good for experience and privacy :-) Unfortunately, it is really more expensive because you need a GPU.

### Generate

After providing an input, click "Go". Then, you will see a window with the complete steps for the veeplet you have chosen and the progress of the generation. Each time a step is completed, a red bubble appears next to it.

### Continue

Generally, a continue button appears after that. Click on it to proceed. This button is provided because in the near future, you will be able to correct and modify the text, so that future generations will take your updates into account, to avoid poor context for future generations.
