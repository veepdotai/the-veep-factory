# CSS Customization

In the CSS tab, you will find tools that allow you to finely customize your document.

<div class="zoom" style={{width: "640px"}}>

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage'

<Image alt="Preview of Veep's architecture" img={require('./images/exemple_veep_css.jpg')} />

</div>

At the top, you will find the usual button to refresh the document display once you have completed your modifications, as well as a button to restore the default CSS, in case you want to return to Veep's conventional display.

You can also choose to use a CSS file that you have written at home by using the file customization field.

Finally, if you want to edit your CSS on the fly, you can do so with the text editor specifically designed to add, modify, or delete CSS. Remember to include commas after each customization option!
