# Personalization of Display

In the display tab, you will find the simplest yet essential customization options.

<div class="zoom" style={{width: "640px"}}>

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage'

<Image alt="Preview of Veep's architecture" img={require('./images/exemple_veep_affichage.jpg')} />

</div>

At the top of the page, you will find a field to customize your company logo. This will appear on the cover page as well as in the headers.

Below, another image customization field allows you to choose the background of the document pages. If you wish to customize the background of a specific page, you will find this option in the "Presentation" tab.

You can also choose whether or not to display the headers, which contain the selected company logo, the footers with page numbers, the table of contents, and you can even choose to skip a page after each title or not.

Finally, you can specify the title and subtitle of the document, which will be displayed on the cover page, and then the name of the company and the author's name, which will be recorded in the document properties.

A button to reload the PDF once the changes are made is available at the bottom of the page.
