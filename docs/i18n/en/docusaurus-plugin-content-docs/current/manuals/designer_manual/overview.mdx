## Customize Your Content

Once your content is generated in substance, you will be redirected to a page where you can modify its format.

<div class="zoom" style={{width: "640px"}}>

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage'

<Image alt="Preview of Veep architecture" img={require('./images/exemple_veep_vierge.jpg')} />

</div>

With this page, you can easily customize your content!

## Display Tab

The "Display" tab allows you to choose the basic settings for the layout of your PDF document. With just these settings, you can design a document that is pleasant to read and straightforward.

In this tab, you can choose the format of your document from the various options presented to you, decide whether to display headers and footers, if you want to skip a page for each new title, or if you wish to display the table of contents. You can also select a background for your document, add your company logo, and customize the author's name, company name, title, and subtitle of the document that will be displayed on the cover page.

<img src={require('./images/exemple_veep_affichage.jpg').default} width="50%"/>
</p>

## Presentation Tab

The Presentation tab allows you to choose your customizations with more precision. Thus, your document will have more personalized features page by page, allowing you to be specific in your presentation choices.

In the presentation tab, you can modify the background of the cover page, the background of each content page, to which you can add an image for better visualization of your point. Additionally, you can add or remove annex pages, and customize their title, content, and background.

<p align="center">
<img src={require('./images/exemple_veep_presentation.jpg').default} width="50%"/>
</p>

## CSS Tab

The CSS tab allows designers to finely customize your document using CSS. You can import your own CSS file or modify the one already applied to the document. You can also revert to the default CSS if you no longer like your changes.

<p align="center">
<img src={require('./images/exemple_veep_css.jpg').default} width="50%"/>
</p>
