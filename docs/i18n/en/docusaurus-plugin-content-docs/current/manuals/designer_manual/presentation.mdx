# Customization of the Presentation

In the presentation tab, you will find more advanced customization options to make your document unique!

<div class="zoom" style={{width: "640px"}}>

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage'

<Image alt="Preview of Veep's architecture" img={require('./images/exemple_veep_presentation.jpg')} />

</div>

At the top, you can customize the background image of the cover page, remove it, and reload the document display once the changes are complete.

Below, you will find a pagination tab that allows you to navigate between the various customization menus for your content pages. For each of them, you can specifically customize the background of that page and add an additional image! If you decide not to set a specific background, that's fine; the default background is the one you chose in the "Display" tab.

Finally, you can add or remove appendix pages, and customize the background, title, and content. This gives you the freedom to add your company's contact information or any other additional information!
