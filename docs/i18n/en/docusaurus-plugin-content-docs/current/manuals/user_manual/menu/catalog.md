# Catalog

You can view the list of available veeplets. A veeplet is a sequence of instructions that allows you to create content or documents in one or more steps.

The veeplets are categorized and sub-categorized. For example:
* Communication/Marketing: you will find veeplets that allow you to create LinkedIn posts or blog articles.
* Cross-functional: you will find veeplets that address multiple types of needs, such as meeting notes, summary sheets...

If you wish to use a veeplet, simply click on Go!
