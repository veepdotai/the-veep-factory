# Content Creation

Veep.AI takes input content and produces the expected content based on the chosen veeplet.

The input content can be:
* A voice recording, meaning an audio you make live in Veep. For now, the voice recording cannot exceed 40 minutes.
* An audio file, PDF, MS Office (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx...), *office (.odt, .ods, .odp), text... Only 50KB will be taken into account (which is already a 100-page book).
* A text provided in the input area by copy/pasting. Only 50KB will be taken into account (which still makes a 100-page book).
* A URL. Please note, only non-Javascript sites are taken into account.

The veeplets are, at the time these lines are written:
* Communication/marketing category:
  * 3 LI posts: to create 3 LI posts with a different tone
  * LI + FB + Insta: to create a LI post, a FB post, and an Insta post
  * LI for the week: to create 5 LI posts, one for each day of the week
* Cross-category:
  * Summary sheet: to create a 5-page summary document (introduction, development on 3 paragraphs, conclusion)

When you click Go!, depending on the chosen veeplet, several intermediate contents will be generated:
* Transcription: this is the text obtained from the audio, file, text, or the provided URL.

:::danger[Attention]
At the end of the transcription, the process stops because you can modify the corresponding content to, for example, correct a proper name or a misunderstood word by the AI.

:::tip[Click Continue]
Click Continue for the generation to resume. Overall, at each stop panel, represented by the corresponding icon, the generation process stops. You must then click Continue for the process to resume.
:::

The veeplet is preconfigured with a set number of steps. You can create your own veeplet and include as many steps as you wish (for example, 30 to generate 30 LinkedIn posts for the current month? We will see that later.)

Depending on the chosen veeplet, the content can be:
* 3 LinkedIn posts, generated with a different tone, allowing you to compare the posts and choose the one that interests you
* 3 posts including one LinkedIn post, one Insta post, and one Facebook post
* A 5-page summary sheet detailing the information provided as input. This sheet consists of an outline, an introduction, 3 paragraphs, and a conclusion.

At the end of the veeplet execution, the items are accessible through the "My content" menu where they can be modified and saved for later reuse.
