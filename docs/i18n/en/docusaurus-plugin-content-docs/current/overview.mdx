# Veep.AI is THE education and execution platform for AI

:::info
Veep is a SaaS application that allows for the progressive deployment of AI within your company, service by service. It automates AI prompts to enhance productivity or create value, as chat-based prompt engineering cannot scale.

It is open source, so you can use your own architecture if you prefer.
