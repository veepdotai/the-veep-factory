# Introduction

Veep.AI allows you to create *your* catalogue of AI assistants that you host (or we host for you) and that you can provide to your learners/clients for a monthly fee, while developing recurring revenue through enterprise support contracts (coaching, training, consulting).

Discover **Veep.AI in under 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Go to https://app.veep.ai and log in using your Google account.

## Dashboard

Once logged in, the following dashboard appears. You can see:
* the number of credits and tokens used
* your recently generated documents
* the latest generated shared documents you have access to (usually the teams/organizations/departments/projects you are part of)

## Catalogue of AI Assistants

You can browse the list of available veeplets. A veeplet is a sequence of instructions that allows you to create content or a document in one or more steps.

Veeplets are categorized into categories and subcategories. For example:
* Communication/marketing: you will find veeplets to create LinkedIn posts or blog articles
* Cross-functional: you will find veeplets addressing various needs such as meeting minutes, briefing notes...

A few assistants (veeplets) are available at the time of writing this text:
* Comm/marketing category:
  * 3 LI posts: to create 3 LinkedIn posts with a different tone
  * LI + FB + Insta: to create one LinkedIn post, one Facebook post, one Instagram post
  * LI for the week: to create 5 LinkedIn posts, one for each day of the week
* Cross-functional category:
  * Briefing Note: to create a 5-page summary document (introduction, development in 3 paragraphs, conclusion)

## Build Your Assistant Catalogue

### Creating a Veeplet

Click on the arrow in the upper right corner of the Veeplet card and then click on "Add to my templates." A new veeplet will then appear in your personal catalogue.

Click on the arrow in the upper right corner of the Veeplet card and then click on "Configure." A form will appear for you to update and adjust each parameter of your copy of the source veeplet.

Make your updates and click save.

When you are on a veeplet and click Customize, a form opens with all the information specified. If you click OK and then Save without any modifications, the veeplet will be copied as is to your workspace. It will then appear in the same category, with exactly the same titles, summaries...
:::

Once saved and closed, you can click on your new assistant and use it as described in the user quick start guide.

The veeplet is preconfigured with a certain number of steps. You can create your own veeplet and add as many steps as you want (for example, 30 to generate 30 LinkedIn posts for the current month? More details on this later.)

### Share It

In order to share it, you need to log in with a demo user. For this, you need to have your own server. It's open source, so install it. If you wish, we can do it for you via our SaaS platform. Feel free to contact us.
