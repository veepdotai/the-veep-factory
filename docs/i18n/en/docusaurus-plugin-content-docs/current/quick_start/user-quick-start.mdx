# Introduction

Veep.AI gives you access to a set of AI assistants for every department of your company through a guided and easy-to-use application to increase your productivity in every direction.

Discover **Veep.AI in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Visit https://app.veep.ai and log in using your Google account.

## Dashboard

Once logged in, the following dashboard appears. You can see:
* the number of credits and tokens used
* your most recently generated documents
* the latest generated shared documents you have access to (usually the teams/organizations/departments/projects you are part of)

## Content Creation

Veep.AI takes input content and produces the expected output based on the chosen veeplet.

The input can be:
* a voice recording, which means an audio that you record live in Veep. Currently, voice recording cannot exceed 40 minutes.
* an audio file, a PDF, MS Office (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx…), *office (.odt, .ods, .odp), text… Only 50 KB will be taken into account (which already represents a 100-page book).
* text provided in the input area by copy-pasting. Only 50 KB will be considered (which still represents a 100-page book).
* a URL. Note that only non-Javascript sites are taken into account.

The veeplets are, at the time of writing:
* Communication/Marketing Category:
  * 3 LI Posts: to create 3 LinkedIn posts with a different tone
  * LI + FB + Insta: to create a LinkedIn post, a Facebook post, an Instagram post
  * LI for the Week: to create 5 LinkedIn posts, one for each day of the week
* Transverse Category:
  * Summary Sheet: to create a 5-page summary document (introduction, development in 3 paragraphs, conclusion)

When you click Go!, depending on the chosen veeplet, several intermediate contents will be generated:
* Transcription: this is the text obtained from the provided audio, file, text, or URL.

:::danger[Warning]
After transcription, the process stops because you can modify the corresponding content to, for example, correct a proper name or a word misunderstood by the AI.
:::

:::tip[ Click Continue ]
Click Continue for the generation to resume. Generally, at each stop panel, represented by the corresponding icon, the generation process pauses. You must then click Continue to restart the process.
:::

The veeplet is preconfigured with a certain number of steps. You can create your own veeplet and add as many steps as you want (e.g., 30 to generate 30 LinkedIn posts for the current month? More on that later.)

Depending on the selected veeplet, the content may include:
* 3 LinkedIn posts, generated with different tones, allowing you to compare the posts and choose the one that interests you
* 3 posts including a LinkedIn post, an Instagram post, and a Facebook post
* a 5-page summary sheet detailing the input information. This document includes an outline, an introduction, 3 paragraphs, and a conclusion.

At the end of the veeplet execution, the items are accessible via the "My Content" menu where they can be modified and saved for later use.

## AI Assistant Catalog

You can browse the list of available AI assistants (veeplets). A veeplet is a sequence of instructions that allows you to create content or a document in one or more steps.

The veeplets are categorized and sub-categorized. For example:
* Communication/Marketing: you will find veeplets that create LinkedIn posts or blog articles
* Transverse: you will find veeplets that meet various needs, such as meeting minutes, summary sheets...

To use a veeplet, just click Go!

## My Content

You can review the content and documents you have generated. By clicking on the content, you access its details:
* Aggregated Content: this view combines the generated items into a whole.
* Comparative View: this view allows you to compare items side by side, two at a time or three at a time.
* Edit Content 1..n: these views allow you to edit and save the corresponding contents. The aggregated view and the comparative view are based on these contents. These will serve as a base for other generations.
* Metadata: this view presents the source, corresponding to the transcription, as well as the prompt used to transform the content.
