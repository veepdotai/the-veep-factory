# Introduction

Veep.AI enables you to create *your* AI Assistants' Catalog that you host (or that we host for you) and that you can provide to your learners/customers for a monthly fee, while developing recurring revenue with business support contract (coaching, training, consulting).

Discover **Veep.AI in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Go to https://app.veep.ai and log in using your Google account.

## Dashboard

Once logged in, the following dashboard appears. You can see:
* the number of credits and tokens used
* your most recently generated documents
* the latest shared generated documents you have access to (generally the teams/organizations/services/projects you are part of)

## AI Assistants Catalog

You can browse the list of available veeplets. A veeplet is a sequence of instructions that allows you to create content or a document in one or more steps.

Veeplets are filed into categories and subcategories. For example:
* Communication/marketing: you will find veeplets that allow creating LinkedIn posts or blog articles
* Transverse: you will find veeplets that meet various needs, such as meeting minutes, summary sheets...

A few assistants (veeplets) are available, at the time of this writing:
* Category Comm/marketing:
  * 3 LI posts: to create 3 LinkedIn posts with a different tone
  * LI + FB + Insta: to create a LinkedIn post, a Facebook post, an Instagram post
  * LI for the week: to create 5 LinkedIn posts, one for each weekday
* Category Transverse:
  * Summary Sheet: to create a 5-page summary document (introduction, development over 3 paragraphs, conclusion)


## Build Your Assistants' Catalog

### Creating a Veeplet

Click on the arrow in the upper right corner of the Veeplet card then click "Add to my models". A new veeplet then appears in your persona catalog.

Click on the arrow in the upper right corner of the Veeplet card then click "Configure". A form appears so you can update and adjust each parameter of your copy of the source veeplet.

Make your updates and click save.

When you are on a veeplet and click on Customize, a form opens with all the information specifying it. If you click OK and then Save without any changes, the veeplet will be copied as is into your workspace. It will therefore appear in the same category, with exactly the same titles, summaries...
:::

Once saved and closed, you can click on your new assistant and use it, like described in the user quick start.

The veeplet is preconfigured with a certain number of steps. You can create your own veeplet and add as many steps as you wish (for example, 30 to generate 30 LinkedIn posts for the current month? More on that later.)

### Share It

To be able to share it, you must connect with demo user. To do so, you must have your own server. It's open source, so install it. If you want, we can do it for you through our SaaS platform. Feel free to contact us.
