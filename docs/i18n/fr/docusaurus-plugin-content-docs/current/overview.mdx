# fr Veep.AI is THE Education and Execution Platform for AI

:::info
Veep is a SaaS app that enables gradual deployment of AI in your company, service by service. It automates AI prompts, to gain productivity or create new value, because chat-based prompt engineering can't scale.

It is open source so you can use your own architecture if you prefer.
